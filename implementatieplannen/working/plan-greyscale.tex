\section{Target}
The assignment of TICT-V2VISN1-13 at the HU which we have chosen to undertake consists of two different components.
The first one consists of writing a image shell which has to ability to extract or modify data from a given image.
The second assignment is to convert an RGB image to an intensity/grey-scale image. 

We will be mostly focusing on the second assignment. This is because we are interested in comparing a few different approaches to this problem.
